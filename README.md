# Odin CV Application
A responsive website that builds a CV in real time using the information you input. Made with React for an assignment in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application). You can view the [live webpage here](https://lukatsanava-cv-builder.netlify.app/).

## What I Practiced While Working On The Project
- Setting up a React environment;
- JSX syntax;
- Using components;
- Using props and states.

## TODO
- Downloading a PDF version of the generated CV.
